We have added a link:{base_url}/docs/settings/index.html[settings] and a links:{base_url}/docs/utils/index.html[utils] section and updated some of the other documentation sections. More to come after the release of 0.20 which will include more complete pipeline/redirection support + support for filenames/paths which contain spaces when doing completion/pipeline/redirection.
