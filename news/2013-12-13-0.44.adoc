Today we released 0.44. Again with new features and new APIs (no, its not compatible
with earlier releases).
Validator, Completor and Converter all have the possibility to be invoked by a specific
provider. This enables the validator, completor and converter to context aware.

The biggest new feature is variable support. It works similar to POSIX variables and is
defined by the export command. Ã†sh can read&write the variables during startup/shutdown.
Another new feature is the AeshContext object which is used to set/get the current working
directory. The AeshContext object is used for completors and executors.
We also added the possibility to execute a command programatically calling the AeshConsole method executeCommand.

Other changes:

* Path resolver (still in beta)
* Filelister improvements
* Several bugfixes: History, Search, CommandValidator
