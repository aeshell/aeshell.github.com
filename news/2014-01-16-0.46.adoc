After several days of crunching we've released 0.46.
The BIG new feature in this version is that every command/invocation is run in its
own thread. For the user it wont affect you much yet, but in upcoming versions we
will implement the possibility for running several commands at once. Sending running
commands to the background/foreground at will ++

As always we've fixed several bugs, especially a lot of Windows related issues.

PS: be on the lookout for Forge2, rumors say it is around the corner....
