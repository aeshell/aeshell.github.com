To support the JBoss Forge2 Beta2 release we released 0.43 on friday. 0.43 is a 
rather big release with several new features and API changes. Internally we changed
how input is parsed so it should be working better with lagging and pasted input.

After some discussion we realized that man (manual pages) would be more fitting
in the main repo. During the port to main we also changed how it works. 
Other stuff we've added:

* CommandValidation
* Possible to override required options (Option.overrideRequired)
* Graphics!
* Better Color support/features
* Possible to specify color/text-type for options
* ls/grep/cd commands have been added to extensions (still in beta stage)
