We finally released 0.20 which include a rewrite of link:{base_url}/docs/redirection/index.html[redirection and pipelines], link:{base_url}/docs/alias/index.html[aliases] and the possiblity to specify the name of the cli.
Redirection and pipelines also support filenames with spaces and escaped spaces. Naming the cli is now possible via the Settings object. Aliasing works similar to aliasing in bash.
