We're happy to announce the first official release of Ã†sh!
It took us a bit more time that first planned, but then this release is one of the bigger one we've had. The single biggest thing is a link:{base_url}/docs/parser/index.html[command line parser], but there are also many enhancements and bug fixes. The release notes can be found https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12312720&version=12320251[here]. Enjoy!
